##MODELS - [Database tables]

Here are all of the database tables written in json.
This links to a nosql database which is ideal for big data.

You can use NodeJs with any database language, this is just my preferred method

I've defined every table in it's own file for modularity.

This makes it easy to read and edit.

There would be a very small, maybe an hour or two's learning curve to understand the principles and syntax, but after that it's pretty straight forward.

A database [model] for nosql is a [table]

To connect to the nosql database [MongoDB] I've required the Node Module [mongoose].


You can see I've imported this in each [model] by settings a varaible [const] - We don't set vars as of ES6!
