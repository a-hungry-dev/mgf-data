This project was designed to show you the benefits to moving into a more modern development approach.

I created the front end using [React] - [Create-React-App]
There is much to learn with react, but it is not neccesary for this project, I used it as a preference, and it is very fast to spin up projects, make modular, reusable components. This is one of the highest held industry standards as of late and is now what people learn whilst studying web/webapp/desktop development. This makes React highly sought after in the development job space.
React has hot-reload, which means even whilst your app is running, you can make changes and it will automatically reload in the browser.

I created the back end using [NodeJs] a widely used back end, built with [Javascript]. Around 40% of backends are now built with NodeJs, not just websites, or webapps, but also desktop programs, and large solutions used in banks, by developers and businesses.
The key benefit of using node is the lightweight, yet Robust structure.
There is no learning curve if you know javascript.
There are hundreds of helpful guides and people out there.

NodeJs can coexist with almost any thirdparty software, and is used by google, Facebook, AWS, Mmicrosoft Azure, GCP and many other big companies.

There is no end to the possibilities of NodeJs. You name it, NodeJs can do it, and more than often..Better than anything else.

You may have concerns on security, learning curves, being able to still continue development whilst learning or implementing NodeJs. The answer is, there are no security flaws if you develop correctly. There is no learning curve except for using javascript, and being able to read an API document, should you need a third party module.

This structure proposed, that I have already built in less than a week (along with duplicating, commenting and fully documenting some of your projects) will have seamless integration.

You will still be able to build a new brochure site from template
There will still be an easy to add Admin interface with functionality, analytics and full customizability.
You will benefit from an easy to debug.

Onto the good stuff...

I know you said you tried agile before, but without guidance it's a very hard principle to adopt. Myself (and Andrew) have been doing digital transformation for years, and worked with many clients that were opposed to the idea of changing. But your company simply wont thrive or survive even if you don't take the next step to keep up with competitors.

With node we're going to cut our development time in half, and the workload will be shared between everyone because it's so easy to do.
There will also be a full CI/CD process that will include automated test deployment, automated builds, automated tests, code quality gates, peer reviews and a semi automated release deployment stage.

The new systemw will also include task management. I will list options and explain them all fully, discuss prices and give my recommendation.
Jira - Full customizability, users, roles, hooks, kanban, release, jenkins

You are welcome to still develop in Visual Studio, Microsoft has full integration for react apps, angular apos, git capabilities and more.

I recommend switching to git, it's the industry standard across the world and there are no issues with mapped drives, copying folders over, making copies with different version names. It's all done for you, giving you complete control and logs of everything.
